Authentication Practice with Node.js, jsonwebtoken, and bcrypt
This repository contains an example implementation of user authentication using Node.js, jsonwebtoken, and bcrypt. It is intended to be used as a learning resource for those who are new to these technologies and want to understand how to implement authentication in a Node.js application.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. You can download Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After installing Node.js, clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/authentication-practice.git
Next, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
cd authentication-practice
npm install
Usage
To run the application, use the following command:

sql
Copy code
npm start
This will start the Node.js server and the application will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

API Endpoints
The application has the following API endpoints:

POST /register - Create a new user account
POST /login - Log in to an existing user account
GET /profile - Get the user profile information (requires authentication)
To use these endpoints, you will need to use an API client such as Postman or cURL.

User Authentication
This application uses jsonwebtoken and bcrypt to implement user authentication. When a user logs in, their password is hashed using bcrypt and compared to the hashed password stored in the database. If the passwords match, a JSON web token is generated and returned to the client. This token can then be used to authenticate the user on subsequent requests.

Database
This application uses a simple in-memory database to store user account information. This is not intended to be used in a production environment and is provided for demonstration purposes only.
